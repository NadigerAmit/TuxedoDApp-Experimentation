# TuxedoDApp-Experimentation
This project serves as a playground for building the TuxedoDApp by reusing Rust code, particularly focusing on the wallet functionality. The primary aim is to compile Rust code to WebAssembly (Wasm) using wasm-bindgen.
**Introduction**
This repository serves as an experimentation ground for building the TuxedoDApp, leveraging existing Rust code for the wallet functionality from Off-Narrative-Labs/Tuxedo: https://github.com/Off-Narrative-Labs/Tuxedo/tree/main/wallet. The goal is to compile the Rust code into WebAssembly using wasm-bindgen, enabling smooth interaction with web applications.

**Getting Started**

**1. Clone the Repository:**
